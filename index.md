```python
def add_two_numbers(number1, number2):
  return number1 + number2
```
This code defines a function called `add_two_numbers`. The function takes two numbers as input and returns the sum of the two numbers.

To format a code block in Markdown, you need to start the block with three backticks (`) and end it with three backticks. You can also add a language identifier on the first line of the block, which will cause the code to be highlighted in the appropriate color.

In this example, the language identifier is `python`. This tells the Markdown processor to highlight the code in Python syntax.

I hope this helps!
